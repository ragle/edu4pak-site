Her mother was left to take care of three daugnhters. With no brothers to work, their lives were very hard. Living far up in the mountains there are no jobs for women.</p><p>Javeria always wanted the chance to go to school, but this seemed impossible at the time. Even though schools are free until the 10th grade in Pakistan, parents must still have enough money to buy uniforms, books, shoes and other school supplies each year.</p><p>Her mother decided to move them closer to a bigger village to find work. Eventually, she found a job as a lowly paid maid, cleaning at various homes in the area. This way Javeriaâ€™s mother and sisters were able to survive - but it was not enough money for them to go to school.</p><p>Javeria was determined to go to school whatever it might take. When she was 9 years old she also began working as a maid for a family. With the little money she made from her job, she bought herself one uniform and some books and began going to school.</p><p>Now Javeria is in 9th grade, she continues to work and pay for her own education through the public school. After 10th grade she will not be able to go an further as she will not have the money - but she can get a job as a teacher. There are not many prospects for girls even after they do receive education up to 10th grade.</p><p>Deeming girls who have not themselves finished their education ready to teach others shows the dangerous disregard for education that exists in Pakistan, especailly for women.</p><p><em>Note: names have been changed and the images altered to protect the identity of the children per edu4pak's policy regarding the safety of children in at risk areas of northern Pakistan.</em></p></div>
