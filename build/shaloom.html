His parentâ€™s sent him to school when he was 5, but he had a very difficult time. The students made fun of him and the teachers did not have the capacity to provide special care for him.</p><p>His older sister, an extremely bright student, was taken was out of school to come help take care of him. Being a girl, her education was not viewed as important. We strongly advised against this as the parents were taking away from their daughters chance of a good education, in addition to their sons.</p><p>Shaloom has since been told that he cannot attend school. He is now at home, his parents both work to make ends meet and do not have time to teach him at all. This is the case for most children with learning difficulties in Pakistan. They are either sent home or if allowed to stay in school they are neglected and abused by the teachers and other students.</p><p>There are no quality systems put in place for children like Shaloom, even in the cities, but especially in the rural areas of Pakistan. Sadly, for now -children like Shaloom with special needs are completely neglected.</p></div>
