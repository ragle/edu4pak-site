	<h4>Sobia Barakot</h4>
	<p>Sobia, 15 years old, lives in a small village in the north of Pakistan. I first met Sobia when I was volunteering at our hospital. She was brought in with complaints of difficulty in walking and experiencing a lot of pain in her legs. She told us she hasn’t been able to walk properly for over 8 years. I asked why she hadn’t come to the hospital before, she looked down and said quietly “We don’t have the the money for medicine”</p>
	<p>I asked about her family “My mother and father were killed in the earthquake, I have one older brother and one little sister.” In 2005 Northern Pakistan was struck by an earthquake that measured 7.8 on the Richter Scale, over 86,000 people were killed, thousands of children were left as orphans. </p>
	<p>As the doctor examined Sobia, he discovered she has ricketts. Without asking too many more questions it became obvious that she did not have enough to eat - ricketts can occur due to poor diet.</p>
	<p>As I talked with Sobia I learned of her eagerness to study. She told me she walked 2 miles every day to get to school inspite of the pain in her legs. “ I have to wake up earlier than the other kids because it takes me longer to get to school.”</p>
	<p>“My friend can walk much faster than me, but she always waits for me and walks with me on the way back home, so I am not alone.”
The hospital was able to offer her free medicine for a few months. She has come back and can now walk properly “ I can go and come back to school with the other children now.” She is almost finished 10th grade, after that she will work, as education after 10th grade is not free. 
</p>
	<p>“I want to study more, I want to be a teacher, but we don’t have the money. I will work for now, I want to help my little sister to get uniform, books and shoes for school.” </p>
