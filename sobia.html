	<h4>Sobia</h4>
	<p>Sobia, 15 years old, lives in a small village in the north of Pakistan. I first met Sobia when I was volunteering in the hospital. </p>
	<p>She was brought in after complaining of difficulty in walking and was experiencing a lot of pain in her legs. She told us she hadn’t been able to walk properly for over 8 years!</p>
	<p>When I asked why she hadn’t come to the hospital before, she looked down and quietly said - “We don’t have the the money for medicine”.</p>
	<p>I asked about her family. “My mother and father were killed in the earthquake, I have one older brother and one little sister.” In 2005 Northern Pakistan was struck by an earthquake that measured 7.8 on the Richter Scale. Over 86,000 people were killed and thousands of children were left as orphans.</p>
	<p>As the doctor examined Sobia, he discovered she had ricketts. Without asking too many more questions it became obvious that she did not have enough to eat. Ricketts often manifest due to poor diet.</p>
	<p>As I talked with Sobia I learned of her eagerness to study. She told me she walked 2 miles every day to get to school inspite of the pain in her legs. “I have to wake up earlier than the other kids because it takes me longer to get to school. My friend can walk much faster than me, but she always waits for me and walks with me on the way back home, so I am not alone.”</p>
	<p>The hospital was able to offer her free medicine for a few months. She has come back, and now she can walk properly. “ I can go and come back to school with the other children now”, she tells me. She has almost finished 10th grade. After that she will work as education after 10th grade is not free in Pakistan.</p>
	<p>“I want to study more, but we don’t have the money. I will work for now. I want to help my little sister to get a uniform, some books and some shoes for school.”</p>
